# Sorting Algorithms

Sorting algorithms arrange elements in a list in a specific order (ascending or descending), which helps improve data management and retrieval efficiency.

This directory provides an overview of various sorting algorithms, detailing their methods and use cases.

## Types of Sorting Algorithms

### 1. Bubble Sort
   
- A simple comparison-based algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
  
- Suitable for small datasets; inefficient on large datasets due to high time complexity.
  
- Time Complexity: 𝑂(𝑛2) in the worst case.


### 2. Selection Sort
   
- Divides the list into a sorted and an unsorted part. It repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted part and moves it to the end of the sorted part.
  
- Works well on small lists or lists with memory constraints.
  
- Time Complexity: 𝑂(𝑛2) in all cases.


### 3. Insertion Sort
   
- Builds the sorted list one element at a time by repeatedly inserting elements at their correct position.
  
- Efficient for small datasets and partially sorted lists.
  
- Time Complexity: 𝑂(𝑛2) in the worst case, 𝑂(𝑛) in the best case.
