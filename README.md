# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) 

## Description

This repository contains a collection of solutions for popular data structures and algorithms challenges on hacker rank created by Zindua coding school. Each challenge is organized in its own folder, containing the problem description and solution. The aim is to build a solid foundation in DSA and develop efficient solutions to common coding problems.

## Contents

1. Each folder corresponds to a specific challenge or topic.
   
2. Each solution includes a README with a problem description and approach.
   
3. Solutions are implemented in Python.
